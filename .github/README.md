## ⚠️ Disclamer

**TireaNVIM** is a personal NeoVim configuration project not ment for wide public use. I am still trying to make it as modular and configuratable as possible, in case I myself would like to tweak something.

## ✨ Features

- Plugin management with [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- Default colorscheme as [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim)
